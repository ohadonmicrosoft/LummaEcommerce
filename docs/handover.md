# LUMA E-commerce Platform - Development Handover Document

## Project Overview

LUMA is a premium tactical and outdoor gear e-commerce platform built with modern web technologies. The project aims to provide an immersive, accessible, and internationalized shopping experience focused on tactical and outdoor products.

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Shadcn/UI components
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, Drizzle ORM, Zod for validation
- **Database**: In-memory storage (SQLite) with future migration path to PostgreSQL
- **State Management**: React Context API for global state
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom theme extensions
- **Animation**: Framer Motion for transitions and UI interactions
- **Build Tools**: Vite for frontend, ESBuild for backend bundling

### Key Features
- Responsive and accessible design supporting mobile and desktop viewports
- Internationalization including RTL language support (English and Hebrew)
- Rich product browsing experience with filtering and sorting options
- Shopping cart with persistent storage
- Multi-step checkout process
- User account management
- Store locator with inventory availability checking

## Current Status

We have completed Phase 1 (Core Experience Enhancement) and are currently in Phase 2 (Advanced Features) of the implementation plan. Recent work has focused on enhancing the checkout process, particularly address management and shipping method selection.

### Recently Completed Features
- Enhanced address management with validation, default address functionality, and improved UI
- Advanced shipping method selection with delivery date estimations and free shipping thresholds
- Improved cart functionality with better state management and user feedback
- Checkout step navigation improvements with visual indicators

### Current Known Issues
- Some type errors in the server-side code (primarily in storage.ts)
- Occasional HMR conflicts with the CheckoutContext
- Mobile menu behavior requires refinement
- Form validation improvements needed in some areas

## Next Steps and Implementation Tasks

The next priorities according to the implementation plan are:

1. Complete the Payment Method Selection interface in the checkout process
2. Enhance the Order Review page with better summaries and confirmation handling
3. Begin implementing User Account Enhancement features:
   - User profile management
   - Order history display
   - Integration of saved addresses with user accounts

## Code Structure and Conventions

### Directory Structure
- `client/src/components/` - UI components organized by feature or type
- `client/src/contexts/` - React Context providers for global state
- `client/src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `client/src/lib/` - Utility functions and helpers
- `client/src/pages/` - Page components corresponding to routes
- `client/src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `server/` - Express backend code
- `docs/` - Documentation including the implementation plan

### Key Components and Systems
- **CartContext**: Manages cart state, item addition/removal, and persistence
- **UIContext**: Controls UI state like modals, dropdowns, and navigation
- **CheckoutContext**: Manages checkout flow, customer information, and order processing
- **Header/Footer**: Main layout components with navigation
- **MiniCart**: Cart overlay displaying current items and checkout controls
- **ProductCard/ProductDetailSection**: Product display components
- **AddressSelection/ShippingMethodSelector**: Checkout components for address and shipping selection

## Development Workflow Instructions

For each implementation task, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
   - Review the implementation plan for the specific feature
   - Examine existing related components and contexts
   - Analyze data flow and state management needs

2. **Implementation**:
   - Follow the project's code style and patterns
   - Maintain type safety with appropriate TypeScript interfaces
   - Use existing UI components from Shadcn/UI when possible
   - Ensure responsive design works across device sizes
   - Add appropriate animation using Framer Motion
   - Consider accessibility requirements (keyboard navigation, aria attributes)

3. **Integration**:
   - Ensure new features integrate properly with existing functionality
   - Update any affected components throughout the project
   - Adapt all project-wide changes consistently
   - Test interactions between new and existing features

4. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Run type checking with `npm run check`
   - Fix any type errors or linting issues
   - Build the project with `npm run build` and check logs for issues
   - Test functionality in development mode with `npm run dev`
   - Verify changes work in both desktop and mobile viewports

5. **Version Control**:
   - Commit changes with descriptive messages
   - Push to the remote repository when features are complete

**IMPORTANT**: After each implementation iteration, always:
1. Run type checking and fix any issues
2. Run the build process and check for errors
3. Verify the application works as expected
4. Commit and push changes to git

## Next Implementation Focus: Payment Method Selection

The next feature to implement is enhancing the payment method selection interface. Currently, a basic version exists but needs improvements:

1. Add validation for payment form fields (card number, expiry, CVV)
2. Implement saved payment methods functionality similar to saved addresses
3. Add visual indicators for different card types (Visa, Mastercard, etc.)
4. Improve the UI for payment method selection
5. Add option to set a default payment method

Look at the existing `PaymentMethodSelector.tsx` component in `client/src/components/checkout/` and enhance it similarly to how the `AddressSelection.tsx` component was implemented.
